# semi-advanced-aim-assist-
This Cronus Zen Aim Assist Script enhances Call of Duty's built-in aim assist mechanics by subtly manipulating the right analog stick. The script induces small semi-circular stick movements (simulated stick drift). This increases the effect of aim assist, making it more responsive and stronger when an enemy moves into your crosshairs
